Imagination Technologies I2S Input Controller

Required Properties:

  - compatible : Compatible list, must contain "img,i2s-in"

  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 1

  - #sound-platform-cells : Must be equal to 1

  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names

  - clock-names : Must include the following entry:
	"sys"	The system clock

  - dmas: Contains an entry for each entry in dma-names.

  - dma-names: Must include one or both of the following:
	"rx"					Shared DMA channel
	"rxN" for N=0..img,i2s-channels - 1	Per-channel DMA

  - img,i2s-channels : Number of I2S channels instantiated in the I2S in block

  - img,cr-periph : Must contain a phandle to the peripheral control syscon
                    node which contains the alternate i2s control registers

Optional Properties:

  - img,clock-master : Contains bitmask for clock master configuration. One
		       bit per i2s channel for channels 0-3. 4/5 cannot be
		       modified and always use MFIO47/MFIO48. If omitted,
		       all channels will use MFIO47/MFIO48

	0 -> MFIO47 = bit clock, MFIO48 = left/right clock
	1 -> MFIO11 = bit clock, MFIO12 = left/right clock

  - img,shared-dma : Contains number of channels to combine for use with the
		     shared DMA channel. If this is not equal to the value
		     specified in img,i2s-channels, per-channel dma references
		     must exist for the remaining channels. If this is equal
		     to zero, the shared dma channel reference can be ommitted.
		     The combined channels must share the same bit and
		     left/right clock. If omitted, all channels will combined
		     for use with the shared DMA channel

  - interrupts : Contains the I2S in interrupts. Depending on
	the configuration, there may be no interrupts, one interrupt,
	or an interrupt per I2S channel

  - resets: Contains a phandle to the I2S in reset signal

  - reset-names: Contains the reset signal name "rst"

Example:

i2s_in: i2s-in@18100800 {
	compatible = "img,i2s-in";
	reg = <0x18100800 0x200>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&cr_periph SYS_CLK_I2S_IN>;
	clock-names = "sys";
	img,i2s-channels = <6>;
	img,cr-periph = <&cr_periph>;
	img,clock-master = <0xf>;
	img,shared-dma = <3>;
	dmas =  <&mdc 30 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 24 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 25 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 26 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 27 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 28 0xffffffff 0>,
		<&mdc 29 0xffffffff 0>;
	dma-names = "rx", "rx0", "rx1", "rx2",
		    "rx3", "rx4", "rx5";

	#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
	#sound-platform-cells = <1>;
