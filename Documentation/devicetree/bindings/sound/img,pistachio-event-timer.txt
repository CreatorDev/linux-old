Imagination Technologies Pistachio Event Timer

Required properties:

  - compatible : Compatible list, must contain "img,pistachio-event-timer"

  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

  - interrupts : Must contain an entry for each of the three interrupts below.
		 Order must also match the below:

		 Internal interrupt 1
		 Internal interrupt 2
		 Internal interrupt 3
		 Event trigger 0
		 Event trigger 1

  - #clock-cells : Must be 0

  - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names
	See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details

  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
	"sys"	The system clock
	"ref0"	Reference clock 0
	"ref1"	Reference clock 1
	"pll"	Audio PLL

  - img,clk-select : Reference select

  - img,cr-periph : phandle of the peripheral control syscon node which
		    contains the event timer external source bank select
		    register

  - img,ext-src-bank : GPIO bank selection for external source. For this source
		       to function correctly, no other input gpios must be used
		       within the selected GPIO bank

Optional properties:

  - img,clk-rate : Initial internal clock rate

Example:

event_timer: event_timer@18102300 {
	compatible = "img,pistachio-event-timer";
	reg = <0x18102300 0x400>;
	assigned-clocks = <&clk_core CLK_EVENT_TIMER_MUX>;
	assigned-clock-parents = <&clk_core CLK_AUDIO_PLL_MUX>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 53 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SHARED 54 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SHARED 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SHARED 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SHARED 57 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&clk_core SYS_CLK_EVENT_TIMER>,
		 <&clk_core CLK_AUDIO>,
		 <&clk_core CLK_EVENT_TIMER>,
		 <&clk_core CLK_AUDIO_PLL>;
	clock-names = "sys","ref0","ref1", "pll";
	img,clk-select = <1>;
	img,clk-rate = <12288000>;
};
