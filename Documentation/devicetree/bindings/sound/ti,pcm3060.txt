Texas Instruments pcm3060 DT bindings

This driver supports both SPI and I2C bus access for this codec

Required properties:

  - compatible: "ti,pcm3060"

  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names

  - clock-names : Includes the following entries:
	"sckid"	The DAC system clock
	"sckia"	The ADC system clock

  - VDD-supply : Digital power supply regulator (+3.3V)

  - VCC-supply : Analogue power supply regulator (+5V)

For required properties on SPI/I2C, consult SPI/I2C device tree documentation

Examples:

i2c0: i2c0@0 {

	...

	pcm3060: audio-codec@46 {
		compatible = "ti,pcm3060";
		reg = <0x46>;
		clocks = <&clk_core CLK_I2S>,
			 <&clk_core CLK_I2S>;
		clock-names = "sckid", "sckia";
		VCC-supply = <&supply5v0>;
		VDD-supply = <&supply3v3>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&i2s_mclk_pin>;
	};
};
