Imagination Technologies Pulse Density Modulator (PDM) DAC.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "img,pistachio-pdm"
- clocks: phandle to input PDM clock
- clock-names: Must include the following entry:
  - pdm: input clock to pdm block.
- img,cr-periph: Must contain a phandle to the peripheral control
  syscon node which contains PDM control registers.
- #pdm-cells: Must be 2.
- The first cell is the PDM channel number (valid values: 0, 1, 2, 3)
- The second cell is 12-bit pulse-in value

Specifying PDM information for devices
======================================

1. PDM User nodes

PDM properties should be named "pdms". The exact meaning of each pdms property
is described above.

	pdm-specifier : array of #pdm-cells specifying the given PDM
						(controller specific)

The following example could be used to describe a PDM-based backlight device:

	pdm: pdm {
		#pdm-cells = <2>;
	};

	[...]

	bl: backlight {
		pdms = <&pdm 2 0>;
	};

pdm-specifier typically encodes the chip-relative PDM channel number and the
12-bit pulse-in value.

2. PDM Controller nodes

PDM controller nodes must specify the number of cells used for the specifier
using the '#pdm-cells' property.

An example PDM controller might look like this:

Example:
	pdm: pdm@18148000 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-pdm";
		clocks = <&pdm_clk>;
		clk-names = "pdm";
		img,cr-periph = <&cr_periph>;
		#pdm-cells = <2>;
	};
